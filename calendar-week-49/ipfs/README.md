### Classification

![](./plots/node_classifications.png)

Node classification:

- `offline` - A peer that was never seen online during the measurement period (always offline) but found in the DHT
- `dangling` - A peer that was seen going offline and online multiple times during the measurement period
- `oneoff` - A peer that was seen coming online and then going offline **only once** during the measurement period
- `online` - A peer that was not seen offline at all during the measurement period (always online)
- `left` - A peer that was online at the beginning of the measurement period, did go offline and didn't come back online
- `entered` - A peer that was offline at the beginning of the measurement period but appeared within and didn't go offline since then

> `AV` = `Agent Version`
 
- `# Final AV` - The last agent version that was observed in this measurement period
- `# Transitions` - How often did this particular peer change its agent version
- `Distinct AVs` - Distinct agent version that this peer transitioned between (could have had a single AV multiple times)

## Terminology

- `visit` - Visiting a peer means dialing or connecting to it. Every time the crawler or monitoring task tries to dial or connect to a peer we consider this as _visiting_ it. Regardless of errors that may occur. 

### Node classification:

- `offline` - A peer that was never seen online during the measurement period (always offline) but found in the DHT
- `dangling` - A peer that was seen going offline and online multiple times during the measurement period
- `oneoff` - A peer that was seen coming online and then going offline only once during the measurement period multiple times
- `online` - A peer that was not seen offline at all during the measurement period (always online)
- `left` - A peer that was online at the beginning of the measurement period, did go offline and didn't come back online
- `entered` - A peer that was offline at the beginning of the measurement period but appeared within and didn't go offline since then

### IP Resolution Classification:

- `resolved` - The number of peer IDs that could be resolved to at least one IP address (excludes peers that are only reachable by circuit-relays)
- `unresolved` - The number of peer IDs that could not or just were not yet resolved to at least one IP address
- `no public ip` - The number of peer IDs that were found in the DHT but didn't have a public IP address
- `relay` - The number of peer IDs that were only reachable by circuit relays

### Cloud Providers

- `AWS` - Amazon Web Services
- `GCP` - Google Cloud Platform
