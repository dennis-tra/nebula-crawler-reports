## Geo location

### Resolution Statistics

![](./plots/geo-resolution.png)

Resolution Classification:

- `resolved` - The number of peer IDs that could be resolved to at least one IP address (excludes peers that are only reachable via circuit-relays)
- `unresolved` - The number of peer IDs that could not or just were not yet resolved to at least one IP address
- `no public ip` - The number of peer IDs that were found in the DHT but didn't have a public IP address
- `relay` - The number of peer IDs that were only reachable by circuit relays

## Latencies

### Overall

![](./plots/latencies.png)

`Connect` measures the time it takes for the `libp2p` `host.Connect` call to return.

`Connect plus Crawl` includes the time of dialing, connecting and crawling the peer. `Crawling` means the time it takes for the FIND_NODE RPCs to resolve. Nebula is sending 15 of those with increasing common prefix lengths (CPLs) to the remote peer in parallel. 

### By Continent

## Terminology

- `visit` - Visiting a peer means dialing or connecting to it. Every time the crawler or monitoring task tries to dial or connect to a peer the following data is saved:
  
  ```sql
  id               SERIAL
  peer_id          SERIAL      NOT NULL -- this is now the internal database ID (not the peerID)
  crawl_id         INT                  -- can be null if this peer was visited from the monitoring task
  session_id       INT                  
  dial_duration    INTERVAL             -- The time it took to dial the peer or until an error occurred (NULL for crawl visits)
  connect_duration INTERVAL             -- The time it took to connect with the peer or until an error occurred (NULL for monitoring visits)
  crawl_duration   INTERVAL             -- The time it took to crawl the peer also if an error occurred (NULL for monitoring visits)
  updated_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL 
  created_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL 
  type             visit_type  NOT NULL -- either `dial` or `crawl`
  error            dial_error
  protocols_set_id INT                  -- a foreign key to the protocol set that this peer supported at this visit (NULL for monitoring visits as peers are just dialed)
  agent_version_id INT                  -- a foreign key to the peers agent version at this visit (NULL for monitoring visits as peers are just dialed)
  multi_addresses_set_id INT            -- a foreign key to the multi address set that was used to connect/dial for this visit
  ```

### Node classification:

- `offline` - A peer that was never seen online during the measurement period (always offline) but found in the DHT
- `dangling` - A peer that was seen going offline and online multiple times during the measurement period
- `oneoff` - A peer that was seen coming online and then going offline only once during the measurement period multiple times
- `online` - A peer that was not seen offline at all during the measurement period (always online)
- `left` - A peer that was online at the beginning of the measurement period, did go offline and didn't come back online
- `entered` - A peer that was offline at the beginning of the measurement period but appeared within and didn't go offline since then

### IP Resolution Classification:

- `resolved` - The number of peer IDs that could be resolved to at least one IP address (excludes peers that are only reachable by circuit-relays)
- `unresolved` - The number of peer IDs that could not or just were not yet resolved to at least one IP address
- `no public ip` - The number of peer IDs that were found in the DHT but didn't have a public IP address
- `relay` - The number of peer IDs that were only reachable by circuit relays
